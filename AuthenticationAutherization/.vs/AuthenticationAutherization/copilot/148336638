You can do this by navigating to the URL in a web browser or using a tool like curl or Postman to send a request to the server.\n\n2. **Check the server\u0027s configuration**: If the server is running, you need to ensure it\u0027s correctly configured to issue tokens. This typically involves checking the server\u0027s configuration files or settings. The specifics of this step will depend on the software you\u0027re using for your authority server.\n\n3. **Test token issuance**: Try to obtain a token from the server. You can do this by sending a request to the server\u0027s token endpoint. The specifics of this request will depend on your server\u0027s configuration, but it typically involves sending a POST request with some form of credentials.\n\n4. **Test token validation**: Once you have a token, you can test if it\u0027s valid. In your application, you\u0027ve configured it to not validate the audience, so you don\u0027t need to worry about that. However, the token should be correctly signed and not expired. You can test this by sending a request to your application with the token and seeing if it\u0027s accepted.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of how you might test token issuance and validation using curl:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Request a token\ncurl -X POST -H \u0022Content-Type: application/json\u0022 -d \u0027{\u0022username\u0022:\u0022your_username\u0022,\u0022password\u0022:\u0022your_password\u0022}\u0027 https://localhost:7059/token_endpoint\n\n# Use the token in a request to your application\ncurl -H \u0022Authorization: Bearer your_token\u0022 https://localhost:your_application_port/your_endpoint\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nReplace \u0022your_username\u0022, \u0022your_password\u0022, \u0022your_token\u0022, \u0022your_application_port\u0022, and \u0022your_endpoint\u0022 with your actual values.\n\nIf all these steps are successful, then your authority server is likely correctly configured.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["What is JWT Bearer authentication?","How can I secure my authority server?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"Explain","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}
